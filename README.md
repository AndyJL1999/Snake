# Snake
A console Snake game made in C++. 
This was my very first C++ project that are worked on by myself. I started learing C++ in 2020. Once I learned the basics I wanted to create a simple console project on my own.
From start to finish, this project was made with what I learned; Classes, Static variables, Vectors, Loops, Exceptions, etc.
I know it isn't much and it can surely be optimized, but I wish to leave it as it is so that I can look back on my very first coding project.
